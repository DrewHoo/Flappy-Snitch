Flappy-Snitch
=============

If Quidditch and Flappy Bird had a love child and named Joust the godfather, it would be FlappySnitch!

FlappySnitch is a Greenfoot based game created by Alexicia Richardson, Michael Hoover, Mitchell Derisio, and Rebekah Stephenson
as a part of a class at Auburn University.
